    <h2>Lydia Philips</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Lydia. I am 19 years old. I live in Ozark, Missouri and just recently moved from California.I have a cat that I stole from the streets, she is so much fun and very playful. I also have a dog who doesn't like the cat as much as I do. They chase eachother around and run between everyone's feet. I like videogames and food. Sleeping is nice too in my very busy schedule.</p>
    <p>My favorite cuisine is Japanese food, I have becomed skilled in both speaking and cooking. I am also half Russian which alot of people dont know about me. With such a deep culture it is a shame how current events are unfolding. </p>
    <p>At the moment I am majoring in Web Development. I am not too sure how this will unfold for me, but I am ready for the challanges. I am not married, and I currently work as a plant specialist in a nursery. The thing I love most about BYU-I is how accessible it is for everyone. The fact that I can talk to someone across the world is really cool. I am going for a BS with hopes of majoring in this program. I like all the creativity that comes with web design. I am also taking a beginners python class which has been alot of fun.</p>
    <p>I have been a member in the church my whole life and am currently serving as a primary teacher.</p>
